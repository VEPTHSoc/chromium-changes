## _Brief Description :octocat:_

These are all the changes that I made to the files and I am sure that 4 out of them work fine which excludes the brownie question. The reason being the build was really slow and I didn't have the time to check the build after adding brownie feature.
I have also described every change in the respective folders. I hope the changes that I have made are satisfactory and correct according to the assignment.

I hope you like(👍) the changes.
Hoping for a positive response :octocat:
