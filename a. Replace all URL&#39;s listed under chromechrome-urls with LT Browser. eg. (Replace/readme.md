# Replacing all urls under chrome://chrome-urls with lt browse

For this I just had to navigate to C:\Users\User\Desktop\chromium\src\chrome\browser\ui\webui and there edit the about_ui.cc
I attached the screenshot below which depicts the changes that I have done.

_Also I figured that I can change the url navigation link but that would have required me to do some more backend chagnes and due to shortage of time I wasn't able to do_
