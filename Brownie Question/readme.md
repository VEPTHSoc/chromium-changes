# Relacing the content of new tab with lambdatest.com

In this task I just had to replace the new_tab html files with the html code of lambdatest.com and hence I did that. I did not make any unecessary changes to CSS as the html file would be using external css here. I made changes to files mentioned below.
```
chromium\src\chrome\browser\resources\ntp4\new_tab.html
chromium\src\chrome\browser\resources\new_tab_page_third_party.html
chromium\src\chrome\browser\resources\new_tab_page\new_tab_page.html
```
